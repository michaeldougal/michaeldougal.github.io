# Want to make a contribution?
Order is a fully open-source project, and I would love to take community contributions that will make it even better! In the interest of quality control though, I've decided to set forth some rules that contributions must follow in order to be integrated into the project. If this all sounds good to you, [make a pull request](https://github.com/michaeldougal/order/pulls)!

## Rules
1. **Style** - Contributions should do their best to conform to the [Roblox Luau Style Guide](https://roblox.github.io/lua-style-guide/). I realize that that's not always possible or practical, so some exceptions can be made in the interest of functionality.
2. **Utility** - Contributions should expand or enhance Order in a way that aligns with the project's design philosophy of making things simpler and easier for the developer. Anything that does not do so will be rejected.
3. **Documentation** - Any changes that add complex functionality should contain comments that explain **why** you're doing what you're doing. This is also part of the Roblox Luau Style Guide (rule #1), but is worth reiterating.
