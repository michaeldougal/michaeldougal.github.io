# Getting started

## Rojo
### Clone the repo
The repository for Order can be found [here](https://github.com/michaeldougal/order). A Rojo project file is included in the repository, so it's as simple as loading up a new place file and serving it up!

## Roblox
### Get the package
If you have some sort of grudge against Rojo for whatever reason, you can also get Order directly from the Roblox catalog [here]() (COMING SOON)
