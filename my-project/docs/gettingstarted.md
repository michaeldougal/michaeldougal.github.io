# Getting started
To get started working with Order, you can use either of the two methods detailed below. Be sure to check out [the API](/order/api) for details on how everything works!

## **Rojo**
### Clone the repo
The repository for Order can be found [here](https://github.com/michaeldougal/order).

A Rojo project file is included in the repository, so it's as simple as creating a new place file and serving it up! If you'd like to learn more about Rojo, see [the official documentation](https://rojo.space/).

## **Roblox**
### Get the package
I highly recommend the professional environment that Rojo offers, but if you'd like, you can also get Order directly from the Roblox catalog [here](https://www.roblox.com/library/11152308855/order-v0-5-0). Installation instructions are included with the package.
