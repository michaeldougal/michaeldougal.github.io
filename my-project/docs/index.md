<p style="text-align: center;">A module loading framework for Roblox created by <a href=PLACEHOLDER>@ChiefWildin</a></p>

## What's so special about Order?
The purpose of Order is to simplify the way you structure your game projects. It combines the best features of the most popular frameworks, and adds a few of its own.

## Are there any unique features in Order?
One of the main goals I wanted to achieve with Order was the ability to have modules with circular dependencies. I've achieved this through a little bait-and-switch style tactic, and it is now fully compatible with these kinds of modules!

## Is there anything else I need to know?
Order is a brand new framework, and I'm still actively developing it. As such, functionality and features can and will change at any time and I'm still ironing out all the kinks and bugs. If you have any suggestions or find any bugs yourself, feel free to reach out! I can be contacted on Discord at chiefwildin#0189
