<p style="text-align: center;">A lightweight module-based framework for Roblox created by <a href=PLACEHOLDER>@ChiefWildin</a></p>

## What's so special about Order?
The core design principle in Order is to **remove barriers and enable the developer**. It combines the best features of current popular frameworks, and adds a few of its own.

## Are there any unique features in Order?
 There are! One of these unique features is the ability to have modules with circular dependencies. I added this because I consider it reasonable for libaries and tasks to need to interchangably use one another's public functions. This is achieved this through a sort of bait-and-switch tactic, and Order is compatible with these kinds of modules (see [Special notes](/order/notes)).

## Is there anything else I need to know?
Order is a relatively new framework, and I'm still actively developing it. As such, functionality and features can and will change at any time and I'm still ironing out all the kinks and bugs. If you have any suggestions or find any bugs yourself, feel free to reach out!
