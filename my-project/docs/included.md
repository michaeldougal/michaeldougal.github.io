# Modules included with Order
Order is separated into branches with different sets of prepackaged modules.

## Master
This is the main branch that contains no extra modules. It just the vanilla, barebones framework.

## Loaded
This branch contains my personally created modules, plus some provided by Roblox. It includes some very useful utilities such as `AnimNation` for easy one-shot animation calls, `CreateTagGroup` for easily tracking sets of tagged objects, `Insanity` for protecting function calls that may fail sometimes, and more.

## Other branches
I have plans to make more branches soon with different flavors of Order, including one for Nevermore V2 modules. Stay tuned.
