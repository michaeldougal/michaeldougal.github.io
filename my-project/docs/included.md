# Modules included with Order

## Tweentown
Tweentown is an extension of TweenService that makes it easy to create, play, and clean up tweens in one simple call. It also expands TweenService functionality by allowing tweens on Models, NumberSequences, and ColorSequences.

## SpringCity
SpringCity is the (pre-release) equivalent of Tweentown that uses springs instead of tweens. It comes preloaded with a version of Quenty's Spring.lua module, optimized by TactBacon.

## Set
Set is a module provided by Roblox that provides a class used to create sets. A set is a collection of objects or values that contains no duplicates and does not preserve order.
